# NTDB_Mortality_Prediction

Code used in the publication: Tsiklidis EJ, Sims C, Sinno T, Diamond SL (2020) Using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) and machine learning to predict trauma patient mortality at admission. PLOS ONE 15(11): e0242166. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242166

Note that we do not have permission to publish the data to github and it is impossible to run this code without it, it can be purchased at [here](https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/trauma/quality/national-trauma-data-bank/datasets/). It is still possible to scroll through the notebook and follow along, however.
